  <p class="text-indent">Keystore file is a file format (JSON) for the blockchain wallet to store private keys. It uses
    user-defined password encryption to provide certain degree of protection, and such degree of protection depends on
    the password strength of the userâ€™s encryption of the wallet. And a password like 123456 is extremely insecure.
    There are two things to note when using Keystore:</p>
  <p>1. Encrypt keystore files with passwords that are not commonly used and as complex as possible;</p>
  <p>2. Be sure to remember the password of the encrypted Keystore. Once you forget the password, you might also lose
    the right to use Keystore, and XTokenis unable to retrieve the password for you, so, be sure to keep your Keystore
    and password safe.</p>
