    number, bank card number, email address, wallet address, mobile equipment information, operation record, transaction
    record of a natural person, excluding wallet password, private key, mnemonic word and Keystore of the user.</p>
  <h2>III. Service contents</h2>
  <p>1. Create or import the wallet. For digital tokens supported by XToken, you may use XToken to generate a new wallet
    or import other wallet tools of related blockchain systems to generate a compatible wallet.</p>
  <p>2. Transfer and collection. You may manage digital tokens with transfer and collection functions of XToken, i.e.
    modifying the account book of related blockchain through electric signature with the private key. Transfer refers to
    the transfer operation carried out by the payer with blockchain address of the payee. Actual transfer and collection
    behaviors occur in related blockchain systems (not XToken).</p>
  <p>3. Manage digital assets. You may add, keep and remove the digital tokens supported by XToken with XToken(excluding
    ETH).</p>
  <p>4. Browse DApp. The user may skip to DApp through the link on XToken and use the services provided by this DApp
    (including DApp of CoinEra and a third party).</p>
  <p>5. Transaction record. We shall copy all or partial of your transaction records through blockchain system. However,
    the transaction records recorded by the blockchain system shall prevail.</p>
  <p>6. Pause service. You know the “irrevocable” property of transaction of blockchain system and we cannot suspend or
    withdraw transfer transaction etc. for you. However, we may suspend or limit the operation of a user on XToken
    software under certain circumstances.</p>
  <p>7. Other services necessary to be provided in the opinion of CoinEra.</p>
  <p>When accepting the services mentioned above provided by CoinEra, the user shall understand the frequent questions
    below:</p>
  <p>1. Adhering to decentralized characteristics of the blockchain, what provided by CoinEra is a decentralized service
    to protect digital token safety for users, which has the great difference with the service provided by banking
    financial institution. The user shall understand that CoinEra will not provide services below:</p>
  <p>(1) Store wallet password (i.e. the password set by the user when creating/importing wallet), private key, mnemonic
    word and Keystore of the user;</p>
  <p>(2) Retrieve wallet password, private key, mnemonic word and Keystore of the user;</p>
  <p>(3) Freeze wallet;</p>
  <p>(4) Report the loss of wallet;</p>
  <p>(5) Transaction rollback;</p>
  <p>(6) Recover wallet;</p>
  <p>2. Since CoinEra does not provide the services mentioned above, the user shall voluntarily keep the mobile equipment
    containing XToken, backup XToken, backup wallet password, mnemonic word, private key and Keystore. If the user loses
    mobile equipment, deletes XToken or wallet without backup, encounters wallet stolen or forgets wallet password,
    private key, mnemonic word and Keystore, CoinEra cannot recover the wallet or retrieve wallet password, private key,
    mnemonic word and Keystore; If the user conducts wrong operation (e.g. input wrong transfer address) when
    transacting, CoinEra cannot cancel the transaction as well.</p>
  <p>3. Since digital token management service which can be provided by CoinEra and XToken does not include all existing
    digital tokens, please do not operate any digital token not supported by XToken through XToken.</p>
  <p>4. XToken is a digital token management tool of the user only and not an exchange or transaction platform. Although
    “Transaction” is mentioned repeatedly in the Agreement, the behavior refers to transfer and collection operations
    carried out by the user with XToken generally, with the essential difference with the “Transaction” carried out in
    exchange or on transaction platform.</p>
  <p>5. DApp integrated on XToken includes that independently owned by CoinEra and provided by a third party platform.
    For DApp provided by a third party platform, XToken only provides blockchain browser for the user to enter in DApp.
    Before accepting or carrying out transactions on a third party DApp, the user shall judge and evaluate for himself
    that whether the service or transaction provided by the third party DApp have the risk.</p>
  <h2>IV. Your rights and obligations</h2>
  <p>(I) Create or import wallet</p>
  <p>1. Create or import wallet: You are entitled to create and/or import wallet on your mobile equipment through XToken,

  <p>(4) You are fully responsible for paying all taxable and other expenses incurred as a result of the transaction by
    the means of XToken.</p>
  <h2>V. Risk tips</h2>
  <p>1. You understand and know that due to the fact that the laws, regulations and policies in the field of the digital
    token are not yet sound, digital tokens in this field may result in significant risks like failure to exchange,
    technical instability and others. Further, the price fluctuation of the digital token is much higher than other
    financial assets. We caution you to rationally choose to hold or dispose of any type of digital token based on your
    financial situation and risk appetite. The market view function provided on the XToken only captures the search
    results of the digital token exchange rate of some exchanges, but does not show the latest market or best offer.</p>
  <p>2. If you or your counterparty fails to comply with this Agreement, related website description, transaction and
    operation tips & rules on the payment page when using the XToken, the XToken shall not guarantee that the
    transaction shall be completed successfully and the XToken is not liable for the damages. In the case of the
    foregoing circumstance, the amounts has been credited to your XToken or your counterparty’s XToken wallet or a third
    party Wallet, you know that the blockchain has the “irreversible” attribute, and the relevant transaction has
    “nonreversible” characteristics, you and your counterparty bear the corresponding risk consequences.</p>
  <p>3. In the course of the transaction, you shall judge whether the counterparty is a person having full capacity for
    civil conduct and decide whether to trade with the counterparty or to make the transfer to the counterparty, and
    also bear all risks associated with it voluntarily.</p>
  <p>4. During the transfer process, if there are similar abnormal prompt messages like “failed transaction”, “package
    timeout”, etc., you shall make reconfirmation through the official route of the relevant blockchain system or other
    blockchain query tools to avoid repeated transfer. Otherwise, all losses and expenses incurred shall be borne by
    you.</p>
  <p>5. You understand that after you create or import a wallet on the XToken, your Keystore, private key, mnemonic word,
    etc. are only stored in the current mobile device but not in the XToken or CoinEra’s server. You can replace your
    mobile device by the means of a synchronous Wallet and others, according to the instructions provided on the XToken.
    However, if you do not save or back up the wallet password, private key, mnemonic word, Keystore, etc. and your
    mobile device is lost, your digital token will be lost accordingly, and CoinEra cannot retrieve these data for you,
    so you shall bear the corresponding losses on your own. If you divulge the wallet password, private key, mnemonic
    word, Keystore, etc. which are being exported, saved or backed up, or if the device or server that saves or backs up
    the above information is hacked or controlled by the hacker, your digital token will be lost accordingly, and
    CoinEra cannot retrieve these data for you, so you bear the corresponding losses on your own.</p>
  <p>6. We recommend that you make a secure backup of your wallet password, private key, mnemonic word and Keystore, etc.
    when creating or importing your wallet. We draw your attention that please does not use the following backup
    methods: Screenshot, Email, WordPad, short message, WeChat, QQ and other electronic backup methods. We recommend
    that you copy the information like mnemonic word and Keystore, etc. on a paper notebook, and you can also keep your
    electronic data in the password manager.</p>
  <p>7. We recommend that you use XToken in a secure network environment to ensure that your mobile device is not subject
    to Jail Break or Root to avoid potential security risks.</p>
  <p>8. Please be wary of non-XToken official fraud during the use of our services. Once we find such behavior, we
    encourage you to notify us the first time.</p>
