  <p class="text-indent">It is often said that your control over the funds in your wallet depends on the ownership and control of the corresponding private key. In blockchain transactions, the private key is used to generate the signature necessary to pay the currency to prove the ownership of funds.The private key must always remain confidential, because once it is leaked to a third party, the funds under the protection of private key are also handed over.</p>
  <p class="text-indent">The private key is not actually stored in the network, but is generated by the user and stored in a file or a simple database, called wallet.The private key stored in the user's wallet is completely independent and can be generated and managed by the user's wallet software, without the need for a blockchain or network connection. The private key generates public key through elliptic curve crypto, and then in turn generates the user's wallet address.</p>
  <p>PS: Users can use plaintext private key to import XToken to modify corresponding wallet passport.</p>
