  <p class="text-indent">Mnemonic Phrase is another manifestation of plaintext private key, which is first proposed by BIP39 proposal to help users remember complicated private keys. Mnemonic Phrases are generally composed of 12, 15, 18, and 21 words. Since these words are taken from a fixed lexicon, and the generation order is also based on the algorithm, users needn't worry about generating an address by randomly inputting 12 words. Anyone who received your Mnemonic Phrases can take away your assets without any hassle. So, after users back up the Mnemonic Phrases, make sure to consider the following three points:</p>
  <p>①Backup as far as possible in physical media, such as writing them down on papers. In case of being hacked, try not to take screenshots or photos and do not save them on networked devices.</p>
  <p>②Repeatedly verify whether the backup Mnemonic Phrases are correct. Once one or two words are mistyped, it will be troublesome for the subsequent retrieval of correct Mnemonic Phrases.</p>
  <p>③Keep backup Mnemonic Phrases in a safe place and take anti-theft and anti-loss measures.</p>
  <p>PS: Users can use backup Mnemonic Phrases to re-import XToken, so as to modify the corresponding wallet passport.</p>
